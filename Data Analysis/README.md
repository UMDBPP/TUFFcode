Here is our data analysis for TUFF DOS. You can find our data in its raw and processed formats in the "Data" folder. 
You can run the analysis files in this folder to see graphes of our data. Make sure you have the "Data" folder as a subdirectory (this is not a problem if you clone the repository).


The analysis from our most recent launch (NS-112) is the following:
